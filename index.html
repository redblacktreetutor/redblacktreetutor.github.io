                        While generally having \( O(\log N) \) complexity for its operations, binary search tree encounters the worst case when the input sequence is sorted. In this case the tree is completely skewed to one side and consequently no different from an array.
                        <br>
                        For example, given the input sequence
                        $$1 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5,$$

                        <canvas id="worstBinaryTree"></canvas>
                        A <em>balanced binary search tree</em> imposes further rules and restrictions so that it has guaranteed logarithmic depth even in the worst case. For red-black trees, those rules are as follows:
                        <ul class="colored-list">
                            <li>Each node is colored either red or black. <code>null</code> nodes are considered black.</li>
                            <li>The root of the tree is black.</li>
                            <li>There are no two consecutive red nodes. If a node is red, its children must be black.</li>
                            <li>Every path from a node to a <code>null</code> node must contain the same number of black nodes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        We can then <a href="http://doctrina.org/maximum-height-of-red-black-tree.html">show that</a> if every path from the root to a <code>null</code> contains \(b\) black nodes, the tree must contain at least \(2^b - 1\) black nodes. Furthermore, the root is black and there are no two consecutive red nodes. These imply that the maximum height of a red-black tree is \(2 \log(N + 1) \).

                    <strong>If \(X\) is black and has two red children, we can perform a color flip at \(X\), making \(X\) red and its children black.</strong>
                    <canvas id="colorFlipInsertion"></canvas>
                    However, if \(X\)'s parent is red then color flip yields two consecutive red nodes. To solve this problem, we perform a rotation based on the position of \(X\) relative to its parent and grandparent.
